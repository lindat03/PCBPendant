## 555 Timer LED Pendant (PCBPendant)
## Description

This project implements a small flashing LED pendant driven by a 555-timer IC (TL555 variant). The design supports a low-voltage operation suitable for small coin-style cells or single-cell LiPo. The board is provided as KiCad sources plus Gerber outputs for fabrication.

## Repository contents
- `555timerCES.kicad_sch` — KiCad schematic
- `555timerCES.kicad_pcb` — KiCad PCB layout
- `555timerCES-Edge_Cuts.gbr` — Gerber (edge cuts / outline)
- `555timerCES-F_Cu.gbr` — Gerber (front copper)
- `555timerCES-PTH.drl` — Drill file
- `pcb_to_easel.sh` — helper script for Easel/other CAM workflows

## Materials

- 1× TL555
- 1× LED
- 1× Coin cell holder
- Resistors: 470R, 4.7k, 68k
- Capacitors: 10n, 4.7u

## Assembly

1. Arrange and route connections between the components of the 555 timer LED flasher circuit inside KiCAD's PCB editor.
2. Convert the gerber and drill files generated by KiCAD from out PCB layout into .svg files suitable for milling the PCB. This will be done using the pcb_to_easel.sh script. 
3. Using Easel, set up your design for milling. Start with the front, followed by the drill holes, and finally mill out the outline.
4. Solder the components onto the PCB board.

## Testing

1. Before inserting the battery, visually inspect solder joints and verify no solder bridges on power rails.
2. Insert battery and confirm the LED blinks.
